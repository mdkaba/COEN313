- Demonstrate understanding of a Full-adder circuit by coding and implementing it on the Digilent Nexys-A7100T FPGA board.

[Lab 2: Sum of Minterms Circuit Implementation on Nexys Board](https://github.com/mdkaba/COEN313/tree/main/Lab%202%20-%20COEN313)

Goals:
- Demonstrate understanding of a sum of minterms circuit by coding it in VHDL.
- Implement the circuit using gates such as AND, OR, and NOT, and utilize port map statements.
- Simulate the VHDL code to generate a truth table of the circuit's output.
- Program the sum of minterms circuit to the Nexys board using Xilinx Vivado software.

[Lab 3: Sign-Magnitude to Two's Complement Converter](https://github.com/mdkaba/COEN313/tree/main/Lab%203%20-%20COEN313)

Goals:
- Gain experience in using VHDL combination processes.

[Lab 4: Shift Register and Maximum/Minimum Value Detection in VHDL](

Goals:
- Familiarize with clocked processes and registers in VHDL.
- Design a shift register file and accompanying logic to determine the maximum and minimum values within the registers.
- Utilize clocked processes to implement the shift register and logic for maximum and minimum value detection.
- Implement output registers to store the maximum and minimum values from the shift register file.

[Lab 5: ASM Chart and Control Unit/Datapath Design in VHDL](

Goals:
- Familiarize with the ASM chart and control unit/datapath design methodology.
- Learn VHDL coding of datapath components and finite state machines at the RTL level.
